"""
Entity update list...more or less a copy of item replacement list,
but I need to update the documentation of both. Item replacement
list documentation is accurate and similar enough for now.

================================================================================
PLEASE NOTE:
This replaces entities AND block entities.
It provides both in the same search, as
- block entities can contain entities (spawners)
- block entities and entities can contain items (not searched here)
- items can contain block entities (shulker boxes, shields/banners...)
- items can contain entities (spawn eggs)

That doesn't even cover commands, but that's a whole nother beast.
Commands can be dumped from command blocks to text files if needed.
================================================================================

Entity update list - this MUST be mutable!

This is an ordered list of update definitions
Each update definition is a list that contains a
    pattern matching list and a list of actions to perform
