# Start

# 1. Make a copy of the dungeon world folder to someplace
# -a is archive mode; copies recursively, preserves symlinks, etc
cp -a ~/project_epic/dungeon ~/tmp/${today}/Project_Epic-dungeon


# 2. Unpack the good copy of the dungeon template
cd ~/tmp/${today}
tar xzf ${dungeonTemplate}


# 3. Edit the dungeon_instance_gen.py script to update the paths and then run it. It takes around two hours. (TODO NickNackGus - update this to be MUCH faster.)
# We need to CD to the path of dungeon_instance_gen.py:
cd $DIR/..
./dungeon_instance_gen.py


# 4. Once it finishes, rename the dungeons-out folder POST_RESET (or something similar) and weâ€™ll add things to it until the reset is done and it becomes the new beta folder.
mv ~/tmp/dungeons-out/ ~/tmp/${today}/POST_RESET/

echo "Done; Run step 2 on the play server"
