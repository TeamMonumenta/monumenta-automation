These scripts are dumb. They will do what they are told, they will not wait for input unless it says otherwise. This means that there is less time waiting for someone to notice something is done, but also less time to fix something that's not right. Most of the commands can be copied/pasted into the terminal to run them one at a time instead.

Make sure all destination folders are moved/deleted before running these, or we might have problems. Backup before using/testing. Hopefully it will work fine either way.

...we might want to change the way this handles directories to NOT use the date in the working directory, but use it to move older files - but figuring out the date for those files is a pain too, so *shrug*
