# Changelogs

Changelogs for the Monumenta SDK. SDK version naming loosely follows semver convention.

You can read versions like this: `[version]+monumenta-[monumenta plugin version]`

## `0.0.1+monumenta-11.1.1`
First release. Has plugins, but not a lot of extra data. Mobs and extra items are planned for a future release, as well as ScriptedQuest files and functions.
